            <Title>Angry Owlbear (17-18)</Title>
            <Text>Region two - Angry Owlbear.
An ancient and bitter Owlbear lives here. It carries an old wound that slows it down somewhat, but it’s power and size makes up for its disability. It's been in the dungeon so long that it's become touched by the Obelisk of Insanity and has gained a strange psychic power. It occasionally leaves the dungeon to hunt, but otherwise exists on a diet of giant rats and stray wanderers. It is a powerful monster and it’s lair is littered with treasure. In no way should the GM hide the fact that the Owlbear is very tough, but that the party could flee if they need to.

Running the Angry Owlbear
Helpful
Characters with high Nature skills and the inclination might befriend the Owlbear, although the chances of this happening should be low. A very generous GM might have the Owlbear appear on the parties side during a particularly vicious fight elsewhere in the dungeon. 
Harmful
This is the Owlbears standard stance, it’s age and pain makes it belligerent at all times.
Disdainful
The Owlbear may have just eaten and might conceivably ignore the party.


17. Bones and filth : Stench, debris, treasure
This large chamber stinks of animal musk and rot. It's strewn with animal furs, bones and dead branches. Amongst this can be seen more humanoid remains, some obviously goblinoid while others suggest larger creatures have also ended up here. The bones all carry huge scratches and many appear to have been snapped in half. Large double doors stand up in the western side of the north wall.

Anyone searching the room may find a suit of normal sized +1 leather armour on a 4+ on a d6+Dex. A character indicating they are listening near the doors can hear monstrous breathing on a 6+ on a d6 or hear noise roll. 

18. Owlbear's lair : Owlbear, treasure
A huge birds nest of branches, fur, feathers and leaves is the most outwardly obvious thing in the chamber. It takes up much of the north west corner, and although empty of life you can see golden reflections glittering in and around the nest. Painted on the walls are scenes of strange dwarf-like figures stood around a black tower in what appears to be communion.

The Owlbear is almost always found here (a 1 in 20 chance otherwise) and will have sensed the approach of the party unless they have managed to travel perfectly quietly, as the Owlbear as a passive perception of 22. It lurks hidden in the south west corner when it hears someone approaching, otherwise it maybe asleep on it's nest. It will try and surprise anyone entering and can be extremely quiet after all it's years of hunting these passages. It should be noted again that the Owlbear maybe be too challenging a monster for the players when they first encounter it, but it moves relatively slowly and can be fled from. It makes for a fearsome protagonist throughout the level, seeking out the adventurers and you might, if you wish, use it to herd them into areas you particularly want them to experience.

The treasure trove of the Owlbear is significant and counts as a major reward, so the dungeon master is advised to ensure they face it in combat if they somehow win the treasure first.

            <Title>The Obelisk Of Insanity (83)</Title>
            <Text>The Obelisk Of Insanity is a huge spike of condensed mind matter from the Far Realm. It runs through many levels of the dungeon, growing in width and function. Various sages have proposed that the origins of the very first areas of the dungeon were to study or worship the Obelisk. While its powers vary from region to region, it acts as a doorway to things from the Far Realm and many of the aberrant creatures found in the deeps owe it their existence in the mortal world. The Toolizith Coven built magical doors to the chambers that surround the Obelisk and locked them with magical Obelisk keys. Each door requires a number of Obelisk keys to open, the deeper doors needing more keys, so that only the highest members of the order may access the chambers. The obelisk itself appears as huge monolith of dark crystal, run through with veins of purple, shifting mists of deep red and filled with captured stars. It is these very stars that the dungeon gets it's common name from, although this fact is rarely know. While the majority of it's vertical shape is four sided, sections sometimes have up to seven sides. Peering into it for more than a minute causes the local surface to become more and more mirrored, although the reflection is warped, often with enlarged craniums and horrible alien eyes. 

83. Obelisk of Insanity level 1 - Chamber Of Violent Runes.

As you push open the huge and intimidating doors stale air fills your lungs and for a moment you hear, or think you hear, whispers. You’re confronted by a huge semi octagonal chamber, lit by floating cold blue lights throughout. Four coiled pillars of green stone support the room, while the floor is covered in the same white and bloodstone tiles as the main corridors outside. The room is dominated by a huge obelisk in its centre. Cut from some strange crystal, the obelisk’s deep purple and blue surface seems to suck in the light somewhat. Looking directly at the crystal creates a buzzing and squelching in your head that is both unpleasant and seductive at the same time. As you take more of the room in you realise strange rune-like objects orbiting slowly around the obelisk some five feet from the ground. These runes glisten slightly and have soft curves, as if they were made from something organic. Dust and debris litter the floor, suggesting this room is incredibly ancient and has been rarely disturbed.          

Two Obelisk keys are required to open the door, three of which can be found on the first level. Inside is the room is very top of the huge purple obelisk that runs through many of the levels of the dungeon and  Floating around the obelisk are eight Farspawn, which appear as runes, held in stasis. If anyone, with or without gloves, touches the Obelisk, the runes awaken, investigate the party and after 1d4 rounds they attack. The touching character is dazed (-2 to all rolls for 1d4 rounds) as their heads swims with misty visions of the Far Realm. They loses a point of Wisdom but randomly gains 1 point in another stat for 2d4 turns at which point they make a save vs. Spells. A failed save means the change lasts until the end of the next day, while a third fail at this point means the change is permanent and no further saving rolls will help. The character may choose to fail all saves. Each time these runes are destroyed, new, bigger runes will form over a period of several days, until then the transformation power of the obelisk is too weak to function again. The bones of adventurers, along with their equipment lie moulding here. Amongst the debris is a +1 short sword, a scroll of Sleep, Magic Missile and Comprehend Languages all cast at 7th level, a well made battle axe, a suit of dwarven sized chainmail, several daggers and a lizardskin bag containing 400 s.p. and 580 g.p. as well as another two Obelisk keys. The obelisk radiates strongly with psychic power and taints of madness. The floating lights are insubstantial and cannot be moved. 

Engraved on the crystal is the second level spell Contact Zhulbluhb'Tck'Nere. It requires a Read Magic spell or similar to be cast to decipher it’s worm-like script. 

If the door to this chamber is left open for a long duration Dimension Shamblers will start to gather here over time, wandering in from the wider dungeon, and at any point 1d6 Dimension Shamblers will be encountered. Destroyed Farspawn will return after 1d4 days, with an extra hit dice and 4 hit points. 

4 Farspawn Mind Worms, 4 Farspawn Teeth Eels.

            <Title>Star Trap History</Title>
            <Text>Star Trap History
Smulhahoozin The Cowled, a primeval wizard of near godlike powers, was fighting a war against the great aberrant race in the dim depths of the past. During one of her forays into the underdark, she came across a wall of something that reeked of madness and the powers of the Far Realm. Her insatiable curiosity caused her to pause awhile to study the discovery. During this time she found the outsiders avoided the locale around the wall and because of this she built an underground fort at the site. Summoning her elemental servants to carve out much of the the rock around the wall she found it rose up further than she imagined, so she sent earth spirits out to detail the size of the barrier while she studied it further. Notorious for her impatience she never the less took her time and was careful to not let the radiant madness infect her. She summoned about her mind-mages, who were greatly disturbed by the object she now named The Obelisk Of Insanity. Some of these psionicists died, went insane or were killed in mysterious circumstances while in study of the huge edifice. Eventually she gave custody of the Obelisk over to one of her thirteen daughters, Toolizith. Determined to win notoriety, Toolizith pressed ahead quickly and wantonly with further research, finally coming to the conclusion that the Obelisk could be used as some sort of cage and was built from the very stuff of the Far Realm. During this period her attendants fought battles with terrible beings that seem to slip into reality unnoticed near the Obelisk and the growing halls took on a more martial and defensive nature. Nevertheless Toolizith pondered what great entity she could catch and bargain with using the Obelisk. Eventually she decided to entice and capture a star being of immense power. It took a century for her preparations to unfold, during which she became more and more secretive and obsessive. It is even rumoured that she took to talking to the Obelisk alone for days at a time. Eventually her rituals were complete and as the stars aligned themselves as predicted, she rang a silver bell that called great Zhulbluhb'Tck'Nere, known as The One Who Gathers Whispers to astrologists. Surrounded by both arcane and psychic adepts, she fought a tremendous battle, both in the world and beyond but after much destruction on many planes, she willed Zhulbluhb into the Obelisk. Before she could recover her wounds and powers the soon to be god of secrets appeared with his then faithful servant and together they slew Toolizith, so that she might not learn the long forgotten whispers the star being could reveal. Events so mythical caused warps in reality and these two battles in such short periods of time created patches of magical and elemental oddity throughout the region.  

Toolizith's followers were broken and fled, burying their leader in her own dungeon, setting traps and leaving immortal guards behind them as then left. Over the centuries that followed the dungeon has grown, both by those wishing to learn the secrets of it's deepest vaults and by others who use it as a home, a tomb or a hunting ground.  

The Gatherer is still bound to the Obelisk Of Insanity, whispering promises to those that will listen, while the undead Toolizith rages in her tomb, waiting too to be freed.</Text>

            <Title>Playground Of Osenzenein (19-29)</Title>
            <Text>Region three - Playground Of Osenzenein
This region is littered with traps and oddities. Osenzenein was, and perhaps still is, a magician of great power but like so many unprincipled mages he grew bored with power and set about creating dungeons and traps throughout the world so that he might amuse himself by remotely viewing those who fall into his clutches. And as with many such unhinged trapmakers he offers some kind of reward for the brave or foolish, should they survive.

Note : All the gems are enchanted to be immune and repulse magic, so summoned creatures and magic hand spells cannot pick them up.

19. Rainbow bridge trap : rainbow columns, gem, trap, secret door
The floor of this chamber is 20ft below the corridor and covered in vicious looking iron spikes. Against the west wall is a plinth that is the base for some sort of great lizards claw that clutches a glittering and large ruby. Between the plinth and the main entrance are a number of 3 ft round pillars that are tiled with coloured brick, these appear in the following order - Red Orange Yellow Green Turquoise Blue Indigo Violet. All over the walls are faded sketches of eyes of many different species. 

Jumping between each pillar is a 3+ on D6+Dex or Str, however the Turquoise square is an illusion and sends the character into the spikes. Jumping from Green to Blue is a 6+ on a d6+Dex or Str jump. A fail causes 3d6 damage, including extra from the spikes. It's a ordinary climb out, but the spikes block anyone attempting to move too far, so only the next column can be scaled. Once someone reaches the plinth the spikes retract and the gem can be safely retrieved. If the character on the plinth makes a 6+ on D6+Dex search they will spot the secret door behind the plinth. The gem itself is worth 300 g.p. and is part of a further reward.

20. Keystone floor trap : door, runes, trap, boot
The floor to this chamber is made from slabs of granite stone unused elsewhere that you've seen. Three pairs of gleaming steel doors lead off north, south and west. The doors have subtle carvings, depicting dwarves hard at work constructing what can only be traps. Dwarven runes are carved above each door. Each door is however identical and none have key holes. The floor slabs are so perfectly made that little dirt has managed to get in between the cracks. 

The runes read "What or question" to the south, "Lies, untruths" to the west and "beneath" to the north. An inquisitive party might seek to find out what lies beneath them, but this is an unfortunate course of action as the tightly bound stone covers a pit trap that consumes the whole floor. It's quite difficult to pull up the stones 5+ on a d6+Str check and hard to spot the danger. The fall is 10ft (1d6 damage). In the area beneath the floor is a solid metal boot made from fools gold it appears to be worth 100 g.p. but is actually only worth 5 g.p. On the underside of the boot is written in common "Two ways through, both worthy routes, but happiness is had by the those that return". The doors can be swung open just by pushing them.


21. Gas and dogs trap : trap, doors, Iron hounds, double gas trap
If the party approaches via the main door.
A set of steel double doors block the way, although ornate door handles in the shape of dogs heads suggest they can be opened outwardly.

The chamber behind is bare and white washed, save for 4 metal panels that line the wall at the far side. The panels are flush against the floor and are about 3 feet square. Looking up, you notice a stone hand reaches out of the centre of the ceiling, delicately holding what appears to be an emerald.    
 
A 6+ on a d6+Dex check will allow someone looking in to spot the crudely carved skull shapes that have been carved into the whitewash above the panels.

The area in front and behind the main door is trapped so that if more weight is applied to the two squares (10ft x 5ft) behind the doors than the two front of them the trap is fired. The door swings shuts and locks. Then the metal panels shoot up revealing spaces containing Iron hounds that have be commanded to rend anyone in the room. This potentially separates the party as heavily armoured characters weigh a great deal more than those without. The DM should ask for a marching order and figure out at what point the trap is sprung. Combat should proceed normally on the first turn, however a yellow gas is released into the room at the start of the 2nd round (before the highest initiative), this affects the entire room and is a poison attack affecting all non-constructs and reduces move to 5’ a round. At the start of the 4th round green gas is released, which is also a poison attack that causes all non-constructs to be immobilized. These gases wear off after 2d4 rounds. If the dog constructs are defeated then the characters can retrieve the emerald, worth 400 g.p. and is part of the same set as the ruby in area 19.

If the party come through the secret door, it's less likely they'll set off the trap by accident unless they specifically examine the steel door.

4 Iron hounds, 2 traps.   

Iron hound (AC 3/17, HD 1, hp 4, At 1d6, Mv 150/50, Sv F1, Mr 12, Al N) Construct
This golem like construction is immune to mind affecting spells, poison and disease.

22. Fossil Trap : ammonite, petrification trap, gem 
This room appears bare and cut from rough hewed stone. Set into the western wall is the fossil of a huge snail-like creature whose spiral shell coils into what appears to be a large sapphire of excellent quality in the centre. Rubble lies scattered on the floor. 

Any attempt to prize the sapphire out of the wall will cause the wall to fall over and into the room. Anyone standing with 10 feet of the wall is attacked by a +5 vs AC attack, doing 2d8 damage. However the characters can rig up ways of setting off the trap and retrieving the sapphire. The sapphire is worth 500 gp.


23. Osenzenein's Reward - NOT 30 : traps, rot-spider, final reward
The doors open into a large chamber, most of which seems inaccessible because of iron bars that separate the area in to cells. The wall are well decorated with scenes portraying great luxury. Against the far north wall is a statue of a alluring nymph holding out her palms, upon which rests a large diamond. 

The bars divide part of the room into four cells. Each cell contains a narrow cylindrical plinth shaped like upward turned hands, similar to the statues. On the south wall some sort of slogan or poem is written, but it’s obscured by cobwebs and cannot be read. 

The text reads in common “Murder cried the drunken man who was backward to the crime, before autumn turned the stout leaves brown the crime was hued a brighter shade, and so done without a thought and beneath a cloudless sky, the vagabonds blood stained cupping hands but did expose him to his rich rewards”. However to read this the characters must somehow push the cobwebs away, requiring a long pole of some sort or perhaps a familiar. The bars are magically strong and cannot be destroyed or altered in anyway. The gap between them is 6 inches and each bar is an inch in diameter.  

The first cage requires the ruby to be placed on the hands of the plinth. If this is done, the bars to the south fade away and the characters can step through into the south part of the chamber. The ruby disappears immediately. If any other type of gem is placed on it, a fireball materialises above the hand and explodes doing 6d6 damage, halved if a save vs wands is made.  

The first time anyone touches the bars of the second cage, a horrible undead rot-spider squeezes into existence on the ceiling above the character and attacks. The spider’s stealth is incredible, and characters are surprised unless they make +6 on a d6 + Dex. If the spider is defeated, the bars dissolve in thin air.

The second plinth only takes the emerald. Any other gem placed on it instantly causes great gusts of green poisonous gas to fill the chamber. The gas is a poison attack that will do 2d4 damage. It also dazes the characters even on a miss. If the character fails their first saving throw, the daze effect lasts until the character has a full rest. 

Placing the emerald onto the plinth dissolves the bars into the third cage. The emerald into dust shatters when this happens. This cage requires the sapphire to remove the bars into the final cage. The sapphire melts as if ice when this happens, the liquid it leaves behind could be collected a used as a potion of longevity. Anything but the sapphire will cause a massive psychic storm to erupt in the chamber. Causing 1d100 damage, half if the character makes a save versus petrify. 
 
The final plinth requires blood. Enough blood to cause 2 points of damage will soak the hands in blood and cause the final cage bars to dissolve. When this happens the nymph statue transforms into a clone of the creature who’s blood was used to open the cage. However the clone is still made of stone and gains +5 to it’s AC, +2 to all attacks and +10 hit points. It is also in full health, stone-like equipment and has all powers, used or unused, that the creature would have. The clone doesn’t talk and attacks the party immediately. If the statue is defeated, it turns to rumble, revealing a large, well cut diamond worth approximately 3000 g.p. If it was set in jewellery it could be improve the value further.

24. Corridor Of Fears : fear trap
A long corridor stretches before you that seems to dim unnaturally. Murals depict spectral ghosts and wraiths engulfing fearful human-like figures. A subtle cold draft seems to come from the darkness ahead.

This corridor is indeed haunted by barely substantial spirits, tied to the hall by some ancient magic. They cannot leave the area and cannot be destroyed. Anyone travelling down the corridor will be battered by a dis-corporate claws, must make make 6+ on d6+Wis roll or be pushed them back 10-40 feet in fear. If a character is hampered three times this way, they start taking 1d6 cold damage with each successful attack too. Once a character makers it to end of the character the spirits will never attack that character again, and will immediately cease their current attack allowing other party members to travel down the corridor.

25. Chamber Of Courage : fresh water, safety
Cool, clean air, as if from a mountain pass, pervades this chamber. An attractive ornamental fountain displaying travellers at rest dominates the centre of the room while artistic scenes of a great wizard defeating demons and congratulating adventurers cover the walls. The entry door is sturdy and heavy metal bolts would allow you to bar the door from the inside. 

The fountain provides clean drinking water and radiates minor conjuration and abujation magic. No evil presence can be sensed from the room or fountain. The doors are truly solid and would require great strength or time to batter down if bolted and everyone in the room is subject to a permanent Protection From Evil spell.  

26. The Immortal Sage : Angellic sage

Before you stands an impressive white marble statue of winged being of noble appearance. It's body flows into tail of seeming fiery cloud rather than legs and it's face is handsome yet half formed. It stands as resisting some blast or spell. In one hand it holds a mighty long sword, while in the other it grips a short blade carved to look like it is burning. Something about the figure leaves you feeling both lonely and sad.

The statue is actually an Angel called Mith Kon Vere, petrified by a spell cast on it a thousand years ago by a sorceress of antiquity. A 5+ on a d6+Wis will identify the subject and any character who knows good stone work will be impressed by the skill of 'maker'. His curse allows him to answer the first three questions he hears on any subject, once month. He knows much about the dungeon and was placed here by Osenzenein for amusement some three hundred years back. If the characters can find a way to release him, he will willingly serve them to the point of discorporation and zero hit points, treat him as Lammasu that uses weapons and armour instead of claws. However his memories fade as he turns back to flesh.  

27. Broken Trap : axe trap, skeleton

This chamber is distinct because of the two huge bronze axe blades that hang from the ceiling near the centre of the room, while a smashed skeleton of some large humanoid lies beneath one of them. It appears that the blades are part of a trap that has failed to reset.

The body is that of a Bugbear and was long ago stripped of anything useful.

28. Nimbral's Staff : cursed item

The room beyond the door is lime green coloured and about 20 feet square. Mosaics made from round dark green tiles depicting many headed serpents occupy each of the four corners of the room. A stone plinth, some 7 foot square and also carved from green sits at the center of the room, rising to about 3 feet from floor level. A majestic staff lies across the plinth, cut from creamy coloured wood and shod with what maybe white gold. Around the plinth lie the remains of three skeletons of approximately human size, there clothes rotted away and only their decrepit and archaic bronze swords and helms remain. Solid metal doors bar exits in the north and west walls. The northern door has a clever pattern etched into which appears as both a skull and a winged angel at the same time, while the west door is plain and a little tarnished.  

A find traps or detect stone work traps will reveal the small holes that emerge from under the the plinth and that the mosaics are all pressure pads. However this trap is a forgery and nothing will happen if the tiles are touched. The real trap is the staff, crafted by Osenzenein's apprentice Nimbral, who was famed for his dislike of incompetence. It works identically to a +1 staff until the first time the player rolls a 1 to hit. From that moment on the staff drains 1d4 hp from the character whenever it misses an enemy with an attack or a target makes a save versus spells cast by the bearer. Worse still the staff cannot be put down, as the bearer finds at least one hand clench around it at anytime. Allow the players to be creative, perhaps a Dispel Magic utility spell will reset the staff until the the bearer rolls a 1 again. 

The door north can be easily opened, while the door to the west cannot be opened from this side and seems magically sealed, requiring at least 10th level wizard casting knock to open.


29. Coward's Reward : minor reward, vandals trap

Another square chamber lies beyond, with plain stone walls. A wooden desk and chair sits dead centre illuminated by a magical spot light. On the desk, which has a single drawer under the writing surface, sits a piece of parchment, a quill and ink bottle. The polished steel door in the west wall has a thin golden inlay that displays a bearded man’s face of noble countenance. 

Further examination of the parchment shows that there is writing on the paper, that reads in common "You have gone far enough and may turn back now. Sign below and your reward shall be beneath you." Below are a number of names written in different handwriting, such as "Gorn The Red Shadow", "Mykul Ottohand", "Thurg", "Twelve Fingered Shinkel", "Utar The Slayer". The ink bottle is full and the quill fresh. If a character writes their name upon the sheet a slight thud comes from the draw beneath the desk, which now contains a small bar of gold worth 50 g.p.

Should a character go beyond the door to the west their gold disappears and their name is magically wiped from the piece of paper. The quill also stops working for them and nothing will allow them to write on the sheet.

Any attempt to remove, destroy or damage any of the items in this room will result in bolts of lightning shooting down from the ceiling, 5d6 damage, save vs wands for half, on each offender per round until they stop. The items are magically strong and require removal and ritual disenchanting to destroy.</Text>

            <Title>The Bountifully Orange Tree</Title>
            <Text>The Bountifully Orange Tree - healing Oranges. Domed chamber that works like a green house, with magical panels on the walls showing fertile pastoral scene that illuminates the tree with sunlight and secondary plants.  Guarded by elementals, this tree is an offshoot from the Tear Garden deep below. The elementals will not attack any group that takes only ripe oranges and there are only ever 1-3 oranges ripe per day. The fruit are highly sought after as they do not require the use of healing surges and heal 3d6 points of damage when consumed. However the Oranges are not quickly eaten and require two consecutive standard actions to consume. If the character stops eating after the first standard action then must continue before resting or the healing power will be spoiled. 

2 Mud Lashers and 4 Lesser Air Elementals guard the tree from greedy fruit pickers.</Text>

            <Text>Recent history of the upper-most level

The most recent group to call the dungeon home are the pig faced orcs of the Screaming Two Skulls tribe. These murderous cannibals were drawn to a long forgotten passage that leads out of the dungeon far north of the main entrance, by their witch doctor under instruction from demons of Demogorgon. They occupy the north east area of the first level and pose a threat to the surrounding population because of their unending need for sacrifices. If the party systematically start clearing the areas around them they will move quickly to claim new areas. The myconids and to a lesser degree the goblins will seek alliances to fight them and a weak party might find allies amongst them invaluable. Thandrak The Black, the necromancer who made the awful device that continues to create undead on the level has descended into the depths, but may return to his lab.</Text>

            <Text>Region four - The Pit : wind, depth 

30. The Pit - SWAP WITH 23

A definite breeze defines these ancient corridors, and all of a sudden you can see why. A huge square pit sinks into the ground ahead of you, surrounded by an unfenced walk way ten feet across. It must be forty feet square and there is no bottom in sight. Above you it reaches up high enough to pierce the ground and sunlight can be seen along with a ragged forest canopy. The walls of the pit are smooth worked stone and you can just make out what might be an entrance to further corridors below. As you stare into the depths, you can just hear echoing booms and possibly animal cries. The pit sucks air into it, so there is no noticeable smell, but somehow it still feels fetid. A corridor on the other side of the pit leads away from the hole in the world. 
      
The secret door requires a standard roll to spot. It is possible to climb down to the next level some 40 feet below, although dangerous as falling is likely fatal and the bottom of the pit hundreds of feet below is a waste dump crawling with giant Otyughs and worse. There is a 5% chance per turn that some flying creatures will traverse up or down.</Text>

            <Title>Entrances to the Dungeon</Title>
            <Text>Entrances to the Dungeon.

There are four surface routes into the first level of the dungeon. The front doors are the first and are commonly watched by creatures within. If the goblins that occupy the halls around the entrance are removed other, more powerful denizens will move it such as the Pig Faced Orcs of the first level, Ogres from the Black Iron mercenary outfit, Duergar slavers or even trolls from the depths might decide to move up. This is area 1 on the map of the first level.  

The second entrance is the huge shaft that runs down into the lowest levels of the dungeon and is open to the surface. All manner of winged creatures use this to move between the dungeon and the outside, most notably a black dragon who would happily eat a party of adventurers abseiling down between levels. This is area 30 on the map of the first level. 

The most secretive way in currently is through the collapsed ceiling that leads to the Fungal people’s domain in area 38. However the Shriekers there will alert the Mushroom King and his people. It also requires some climbing and is very difficult to find from the surface as the collapse is hidden in a wooded dell.

The fourth way in is found 3 miles from the main gate, and is a narrowing winding tunnel that leads to the ancient temple complex currently occupied by the Pig Faced Orcs. It’s guarded by the orcs and unless they are wholly wiped out will always lead to confrontation if used.

            <Text>Lost and forgotten Freya
This areas consists of two rooms, the first trapped and seemingly empty except for a few scattered bones, while the second is hidden and contains four Shadow Spirits and treasure.

The door to chamber A is the switch to the magical trap in the room beyond. TRAP It's a hard level 4 DC to spot the faint runes on the rim of the doorway, to disarm the trap a further . Once activated the first chamber is thrown into magical darkness that blocks normal and low-light vision completely. However because of the divine nature of the statue in the chamber B, this magic is nullified every other round, starting on the first round after the door has been opened. Once the door as been opened describe the room.

This chamber beyond the door is relatively empty, a few bones lie scattered about the 20ft wide by 40ft long room. The room smells dry and lifeless with crude but effective murals adorning the plastered walls that depict black humanoids descending on maidens who appear to offer no resistance. The ceiling is quite low and unfinished. You are just beginning to take more of the room in when suddenly the place is plunged into total darkness.     

The players should roll for initiative and describe what they do before you lay out any floor plans. Also roll initiative for the Shadows, however in the first round the characters are surprised and the Shadows may act first. The secret door leading to the second chamber silently descends into the floor before the Shadows act, allowing them to move and charge into characters who have stumbled into the dark room. The next round the darkness is nullified once more, and you can layout the positions of the characters and Shadows as normal. The Shadows will not move out of the first chamber, but can be pushed or pulled out. At the very end of the second round the darkness falls again. Remove the Shadows, remembering where they were for movement purposes and treat the characters as Blind. This repeats until the Shadows are destroyed, the characters are killed or have fled.

In the second chamber on a black stone plinth is a beautiful golden statue of a fair maiden, similar those depicted on the walls. It radiates magic and even without including its enchantment is worth at least 500 gp. However the plinth is XX trapped, (spot lvl 1 medium DC) and difficulty to disarm (lvl 4 medium). If set off, an area 2 burst around the plinth is affected by a wave of lesser death, a +7 vs. Fortitude attack doing 2d8+4 damage necrotic damage and the target is weakened (save ends). If the first save is failed the target is weakened until the end of their next extended rest.

Statue Of Freya (item)
Freya is a forgotten exarch of a dead god of truth and beauty. When clasping the statue, which weights the same as light shield, the bearer gains immunity to blindness and darkvision but can only use one handed weapons and implements.</Text>

If you don’t wish to use the megadungeon as a completely open sandbox, or want to introduce the dungeon in a different way you can use one or more following quest ideas. These quests provide extra experience points on completion in addition to any other benefits promised the player characters. These are awarded per character involved in the quest. 

The Alchemists Fruit - 150xp
Hanwell Birge, a budding alchemist has found an obscure reference to the Orange Tree on the first level of the dungeon. He contacts the party wishing to hire them to protect him while he attempts to retrieve a magical Orange from the tree. The Hanwell has a partial map, showing the directions to the tree. He offers 100 g.p. + 500 g.p. paid on safe return.

            <Title>Approaching the dungeon </Title>
            <Text>Approaching the dungeon
The main entrance to the dungeon lies at the end of ravine, and is framed by cliffs that reach 30 to 40 feet before beginning to level out into a plateau above the dungeon. In ages past dwellers carved windows into the ravine walls so that they could spy on anyone approaching. Now these chambers are occupied by a goblin tribe who are happy to shoot at fresh-faced adventurers as they approach.

After several days of travel through rough woodlands and hills you are finally nearing the site of the fabled Star Trap Dungeon. A huge cliff runs in front of you, split by a ravine which is meant to led to the great doors of the dungeon. The cliffs are at least 30 feet high and seem to run off in both directions for many miles. As you approach the ravine it is impossible to ignore the tracks that precede you. Many creatures have walked this path, some with feet far bigger than your own and for a moment you falter as you consider what could have made such tracks. However the lure of riches beyond belief and secrets a thousand years old keeps you moving.

Rangers and druids will identify men, goblin, wolf, bear, troll and giant or ogre footprints, but also a least three other tracks of unknown type that have regularly trod the path.  

Some 150 feet before you the ravine comes to an end, where the doors to the dungeon stand. Huge slabs of black rock, 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall, are carved to form arched double doors. Massive rings of brass form handles and the whole thing is framed in skulls each half as tall as a man.  

Unless the players approach stealthy and cling to one side of the ravine, goblins from either side will rain crossbow bolts down upon them. The goblins have a passive perception of 18 that all characters must beat to get to the doors unseen. Otherwise it will take about three turns for the players to run from where the goblin arrows can reach theme to the door. Each turn players are targeted by two +1 vs AC 1d6 damage attacks from goblin bows. Upon reaching the door they need to roll a 4+ on a d6+Str check to open the heavy doors, this check can be aided at +1 per character helping and can be re-rolled each turn but only once per turn, during which the characters are subject to further bow attack. If you wish to run this using a battlemap, the characters start 30 squares from the doors. Characters who make for the sides of the ravine are only targeted by a single +1 vs AC 1d6 damage from the other side of the ravine. The windows that the goblins shoot from are covered by vines and are built in such a way as to disguise them. A character wishing to target the windows must make 4+ on d6 + Dex to spot the windows, and then hit AC 1/19 to hit a goblin. Area effect powers that target the window will stop shooting from that side for a turn while the goblins duck down.

As you approach the doors a shrill whistles pierces the quiet and black crossbow bolts start shooting down at you from either side of the ravine. The doors are close but there still lies 150 feet between you and them. 

When the players reach the doors,

The doors are even more impressive when you reach them, cut from a single piece of black marble flecked with white crystals, they almost appear like they are made from the night sky. The brass handles are made for bigger hands than yours and while the doors seem perfectly functional it will take strength to open them, all the while the carved skulls of giants and demons leer at you from the door frame. As you grasp the handles, script magically appears on the doors, written in a language unfamiliar yet understandable, "I shall tame the very stars".

Once the party are inside and safe from the crossbows,

A huge corridor stretches into the darkness far in front of you. Twenty feet wide, the hall vaults reach up at least twenty feet to the ceiling also and are high enough to allow passage for giants. As you examine your surrounding the first thing you notice are the large ivory and bloodstone tiles that line the floor and although streaked in mud these tiles are undamaged in anyway. Along the walls are faded drawings, showing a grand procession walking towards the entrance. Although in an unfathomable style it is clear than all manner of races march along, some recognizable and some utterly alien. These drawings have been scratched at and painted over in places. In other places new work covers up the older drawings in layer upon layer and the sense of age of the place is intense. You wonder what monstrous things have stood where you stand now. Close by are two sets of oak and iron bound double doors, set opposite each other in the corridor. These doors and the darkness of the tiled hall seem you're only options for exploration.</Text>

Acid Room Trap – The floor of the room is well below the corridor leading to it. Stone handles for climbing down are chiseled into the wall and are obvious, as is the square pool of dark liquid. A doorway on the other side of the room is more ornate than usual.
The trap is twofold, any pressure on the floor will cause it to sink, forcing the acid to out quickly. Any characters on the floor will start taking more and more acid damage each round. Secondly acid is also pumped out from the top of the stone handles, making it harder to climb out and damaging, while adding to the rising acid. It’s possible to wedge the floor so that it doesn’t sink, but the acid from the handles will still come out. The sinking floor trap is medium difficulty to spot and medium to disarm, while the handles traps is hard to spot and hard to disarm.
The ornate door is locked (medium) and trapped (medium, medium) causing a blast of electricity that pushes 1 square back, possibly into the acid.

            <Text>Alternative Character creation rules.

1. Choose between picking a class you are aiming for or rolling completely randomly.

If you roll randomly, roll 3d6 six times, and write them down in order against Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution and Charisma. Then roll a further 3d6 and if it’s higher than your best result replace it.

If you decide you are aiming for a particular class or any of the racial multi-classes you should check the class requirements and then roll 3d6 six times, assigning them to your stats once you have completed. If you failed to meet the requirements, you must pick another class entirely although it is likely to similar. You do not have to stick with the particular race you chose. E.g. if you wanted to play an elven fighter/magic-user but you only got the stat rolls for a Fighter, you can play a Dwarf or Human fighter.

2. Roll on the relationships table, in secret, about the your characters relationship with the character of the player to the left of you. If you get a secret relationship, roll again to find a public relationship that covers the secret one. If you gain gold from the relationship table, make that in secret. You then discuss with the the story behind the relationship. This is repeated around the table, skipping the DM of course, until all player characters have a relationship. If you absolutely hate your relationship, you may re-roll once.

3. Choose a first name, last name, title or nom de plume, which may or may not be related to your relationship with another player. Tell the person you have a relationship with your name.

4. Hit points at first level are always at least half you maximum, so when you roll for hit points if it’s less than half you just take the half value.

            <Title>Fungus Caves (35-46) </Title>
            <Text>Region Five - Fungus Caves (35-46)
The Fungus caves are actually collapsed sections of the dungeon where an overhead river burrowed down and made the area unstable, causing cave-ins. The system of cave-like chambers are ruled by The Mushroom King, a canny Fungal leader, who defends his spores with a strange and alien intelligence. He has a deal with the goblins, who provide rotting logs in return for magic mushrooms and Shrieker spores. He has his people lay out rotting meat along a path to draw the spawn of the Slimelord out into the wider dungeon and away from the fungal caves. He also pacifies various giant insects using one of his many spore clouds. These insects effectively ignore the Fungi now and act as unwitting guards. 

Running the Fungi people

The Mushroom King seeks to protect his flock and work untiringly and cleverly to cancel or destroy creatures who might threaten the myconids. However The Mushroom King will most likely want to parley with the adventurers before combat. He is psychic, using telepathy to talk in any language. The King is allied with the goblin Reaping Madkin, who he has manipulated into providing him with a great deal of information about the 1st level of the dungeon. He too is concerned about the Pig-Faced orcs and will aid the adventurers against them, possibly by supplying them with poisons and potions, but mostly with advice and information. He will certainly act as a go-between if the party want to talk to the goblins. He is tricky though and will see the party as danger to the long term balance of the level and if they deal with the orcs happily send them through the one way teleport into the Tomb Of Judder, without telling them that so far it’s been a one way trip. The King himself is highly intelligent but also quite alien. He’ll constantly describe to whoever he is communicating their features and mannerism for example, and if he stands still anyway the ground around him will start to erupt in small mushrooms of various types.  
 
Helpful
If the characters can convince the King that they mean no harm to his flock he may aid the party against particular foes. He worries a great deal about the Orcs and is also concerned about whatever haunts the crawling warrens. He has an alliance with the Beetle Herder and may travel with the party to parlay with her to gain access to the Tomb Of The Judder. The King distrusts mammal life forms, and so the party will need to make offerings and placations towards him at first. Madkin the goblin shaman might be useful here, if the party has been deemed the tribes saviours. The King also knows that the secret to opening the door to the obelisk on this level involves find the keys, of which he has one.  
Harmful
If the party attack the fungus folk without provocation the King will declare war on them. He may send myconids out to lure them into fighting the Owlbear or the undead. He also knows the secret to a spore spray that attracts slimes and molds, which maybe his revenge if they party confront him directly.
Disdainful
This is the Kings default position, he’ll attempt to drive away the party without direct combat, if he considers them powerful, he may well attempt to bribe them or offer useful information that leads them away from his domain. 

35. Slimey entrance way : mushrooms, collapse
As you move down the corridor you notice a slight breeze that brings with it damp air and an earthy smell, tinged with a putrid taint. Little by little you notice the cold stone ways of hall become encrusted with lichen, mold and even fungus. You seem to be approaching an open doorway ahead and it seems mud and earth spill from it. 

In the chamber beyond, the walls and ceiling have partially collapsed, becoming much more uneven and rough, further into the ruined dungeon the fungus and mold becomes much more prevalent and the previous rectangular nature of the dungeon gives way to an almost cave like feel. Ahead natural light sparsely filters in from high up above. 

36. Rotting meat : rotting meat, stench
The reek of rotting meat assaults your senses, and you spot carcasses littering the floor, lined up along the eastern wall. The animals seem to be various forest creatures, although there are some bones that indicate more intelligent creatures have lain here as well. 

Pieces of rotting meat are used by the Mushroom king to lure the spawn of Jubliex from area 37 towards the main dungeon and away from his flock.

37. Spawning ground Of The Slimelord : decay, sphincter altar, oozes, treasure
Filth and slime have completely overtaken the tumbled walls of the dungeon in this area, the smell of mold is overpowering and even the air feels rotten. Slime covered pools of stagnant water and litter the floor particularly around a large and disturbing block of what appears to soap stone in the center of the room. It has been carved into the shape of some kind of sphincter like that of a huge slug or sea beast. A dull keening surrounds you, seemingly without source. Glints of metal catches the light from your torches further into the cave. The very walls seem to be moving.

Jubliex the Slimelord once had a hidden shrine in this chamber and was worshipped by a long vanished gang of Kobolds. Now only the horrible sphincter shaped soapstone altar remains, which occasionally spews forth an ooze, slime, jelly or mold. Currently two Green Slime, a Grey Ooze, a Gelatinous Cube all reside in here and would be extremely dangerous should the players stumble in, as the are all hard to spot - 5+ on d6 + dex. Their acids have failed to dissolve a suit of +1 chainmail, 230 g.p. and 3 rubies worth 100 g.p. each. Finally an Obelisk key can be found amongst the filth. Players, especially druids, might seek to destroy the altar and will need strong magic to do so. If they are successful they will be cursed by Jubilex, but receive favour from other nature aligned gods and patrons. They Fungal Folk will not be entirely grateful either as their region is avoid because of it’s association with oozes.      

Greenslime (AC na, HD 2, hp 6, At special, Mv 3/1, Sv F1, Mr 12, Al N) Ooze
Greenslime dissolves anything non-magical it touches in 1d4 rounds, including armour and bodies.  They are immune to mind affecting spells, disease, non-magical weapons, cold and lighting. Fire does double damage and cure disease spells kills them instantly.

Grey Ooze (AC 8/12, HD 3, hp 11, At 2d8, Mv 10/3, Sv F2, Mr 12, Al N) Ooze
The first hit from a Grey Ooze doesn’t do damage but destroys the armour of the victim, if they are wearing any. They are immune to mind affecting spells, disease, fire and cold.

Gelatinous Cube (AC 8/12, HD 4, hp 16, At 2d4, Mv 60/20, Sv F1, Mr 8, Al N) Ooze
Surprise on a 2+. Save vs paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds, during which the cube engulfs the opponent and automatically does it’s acid damage.



38. Shriekers! : shriekers, light, a way up. 
More light comes in from the broken ceiling here, illuminating a large cave-like chamber that’s filled with debris and soil from above. Numerous small plants try and get a foot hold in rays of sunlight but the majority of the room is over run by mushrooms both huge and small, arrayed in a variety of colours. 

Unless the characters entering this area are silent or invisibly read the following also. 

As you step closer, howling gaseous shrieks start up from large purple mushrooms that line the walls, no doubt alerting anything nearby to your presence. 

There are 4 shrieker mushrooms here that rely on vibrations and changes in light to detect intruders. 

If the characters manage to enter the mushroom kingdom without detection they’ll take the Fungus people by surprise at first and the DM should adjust their reaction accordingly. Characters can climb up and out of the dungeon if they have rope and grappling hook. If they do, they find themselves in a dense wood at the top of the plateau the dungeon buries into. Finding a way down to the trail back to the city of Corsent adds an extra day to the journey but provides a more secretive rout  into the dungeon, if the Fungal people are dealt with, one wa  or another. 

4 Shriekers (AC 7/13, HD 3, Hp 16, At none, Mv 9/3, Sv F1, Mr 12, Al N) Fungoid
If a Shrieker detects light within 60 feet or movement within 30 feet it will emitting a loud piercing sound for 1d3 rounds, that will attract Fungal folk. The sound might even stun creatures sensitive to loud noise. Save vs Spells or be held for 1d4 rounds.




39. Sinkhole : collapsing floor
As this narrowing cave ends the murky slurry of water seems to disappear into the floor. Moving closer you can see an area of collapse ahead of you and that the stream actually falls into a pit or chamber below. 

Getting with 10 feet of the hole is dangerous as the floor may collapse, dwarves may well spot this early. For each character that approaches roll a d6 and on a 1 the floor gives way and the an area 20 feet in diameter falls down 20 feet into the chamber on the second level below. The collapsing stonework adds an addition dice to the damage taken for a total of 3d6 damage.  

40. The Beehive : buzzing, bloated corpses, bees

A dull buzzing drones from what appears a huge growth of some sort that clings to the walls in this nook. The brown shell is punctuated with hexagon shaped holes the size of a human head and a vague sweet smell lingers in the air. A bloated and decomposing goblin corpse lies some 15 feet from the structure.

Killer Bees, about the size of bats have a hive about 10 feet in height here. They use holes in the collapsed ceiling to pass to and from the forest above. Occasionally bees will go find the Orange tree and collect nectar from its flowers. At any one time 5 bees will be around to protect the hive. The corpses of several goblins lie scattered here all showing signs of stings, providing a clue to the danger posed. The honey the bees collect is magical because of the orange blossom and if eaten provides the effects of a potion of healing. A potion bottle can store 2 doses and there is enough honey for 4 such portions. 

5 Killer Bees (AC 7/13, HD 1d4, Hps 2, At 1d3 + poison, Mv 90/30, Sv H0, Mr 9, Al N) Insect
Poison, save versus poison or die in 1d6 rounds. Stinging an opponent kills the bee.

41. The Fungal Field : a forest of mushrooms
The space opens up further revealing a vast dimly sun-lit chamber. Streamers of vegetation hang from the ceiling above you, and in places gaping holes in the roof reveal the open air. About you is strewn dank rotting wood and soil, all of which is covered in a variety of multicoloured mushrooms and fungi that collectively form a forest. Some are huge, well over the height of a man, and it appears that a few of these are swaying as if a wind blows through here.

This large room is counted as difficult terrain and therefore movement for the PC’s is halved because of the vegetation and rot. A great number of Myconids live here, many of which are non-combatants and often just behave for extended periods of time as unintelligent mushrooms. However anyone seeking to harm the flora will be resisted by 6 Fungal Herders and 2 Fungal Guards. If the shriekers have alerted the Myconids, the King and his guard will arrive here with 1d4 turns and seek to understand what the party want.

42. Mouldery : Fungal kindergarten, guards
Cramped and humid, mushrooms fill this chamber floor to ceiling, while five animate fungi seem to guard a circle of particularly small mushroom creatures. The guards seem perturbed by your appearance and are reacting aggressively.

Mushrooms yet to become animate cover the rot in this room. These Fungal buds are guarded at all times by 4 Fungal guards, 2 Fungus herder and a Rot Priest.

43. Chamber of The Mushroom King : throne, poison
A huge mouldy wooden throne dominates this chamber. It’s appears to have been carved from from base of a massive tree and completely covered in mushrooms, toadstools and other fungi. Stone bins line the back of room, and a long table is covered in strange alchemical looking equipment.  

In the unlikely event that the Mushroom King is still in the chamber.

Sat on the throne is a tall and venerable looking mushroom man. Great lengths of fungus hang from him like imperious robes and a golden crown sits on his head. Deep set eyes gaze at you all ponderously as his guard rush to form a protective circle around him.

Both the throne and the stone bins are trapped. The fungi on the throne are poisonous to non mushroom based races, save versus poison or take 1d4 points of damage per round until dead.

The stone bins contain treasures that the Fungal people have learned can be used to bribe other races. There is 780 g.p. and 920 s.p. Several pieces jewelry are scattered in amongst the contains, including two gold rings work 100 g.p. each, a hairpin made of mithril and moonstones worth 500 g.p. and a Brooch Of Shielding with 18 hps worth of absorption left.  A silver and brass scroll case, worth 150 g.p. also in the bins contains a cursed scroll. 
 

44. Scuttling Things : beetles
Slimy black mold covers the walls and floor of this tumbled down chamber, and clambering over the broken stone and earth are a multitude of scuttling things. Beetles and centipedes crawling throughout the cave, some much better than others. Suddenly two of the larger beetles appear to burst into flame and cast a glowing radiance over the chamber. 

The insects here are easily aroused to violence, anyone using fire or similar methods to clear a path through the insects will be attacked. The Boring beetle will start at the southern exit of the cave, while the centipedes will appear surrounding the party one turn after another. The whole floor will become difficult terrain until damaging area effect spells are used on those squares.

45. Cave Of The Beetle Herder
Yet more debris litters this chamber, although what appears to be a circular tent dominates your view. All around scuttle more insects and the floor seems almost to be moving. The tent is made from wooden branches and covered in mouldy cloth.   

A moody Banshaer hermit tends her flock of giant beetles and brews strange concoctions in her tent to sell in the deep market. The beetles are unlikely to attack unless provoked as the hermit keeps them well fed, however she will react using her druidic magic if the players act aggressively, with the beetles rushing to defend her. She makes and keeps numerous potions (2 healing, one each of resistance to fire, lightning and cold, 2 potions of neutralise poison, 2 fire breathing potions). The Banshaer keeps hidden beneath loose rocks 280 g.p.

 Running the Beetle Herder
Helpful
The Beetle Herder knows that the throne teleports those who sit on it away and has never seen anyone come back. She might offer this information to the characters. She might also offer the party potions, in return for promises about not attacking insects. If the party bring her evidence of the work of the Grue and the dead larvae she will wish to go and deal with the Grue, and seeks the parties help to do so.
 She will also offer to sell her potions at 3d6 x 15 g.p. each and will take orders, although brewing them takes 2d4 days per potion.

Harmful
She’ll take umbrage at a party that wantonly attack her flock and will do everything she can to destroy them. She’ll also offer rewards to the goblins and bargain with the Fungal King to have them capture or kill the party. 

Disdainful
The Banshaer will not offer up any advice or claim to know much about the level at all, but will offer potions for sale, at 3d6 x 20 g.p. She won’t be further coming with the offer to make further potions for them, believing the party will be killed before they can come to collect them.  

46. Ancient Throne Room (remove corridor 46) : teleporter
A large bare chamber that is comparatively dry and debris free, this chamber displays only small signs of the collapse of the other areas locally. In the centre of the room is a raised stone platform, quite plain except for linked chain motifs chiselled into the rock. On top of the platform is a large and important looking stone chair. 

The chair radiates magic, and if sat on properly it teleports the individual to an identical chair in Tomb Of Judder, a hidden section on this level. This is a one way teleport. The teleport works only when the target chair is empty, but functions any number of times.</Text>

            <Title>Grubby Dog Goblin tribe </Title>
            <Text>Grubby Dog Goblin tribe – The Grubby Dog goblin tribe is down on its luck and fractured. Some goblins follow the Barghest Lord Horse Gutter have named themselves the Purple Bruise clan, while others follow the tribal leader Grodsnik Heart Chewer and are called the First To Eat clan. The tribe is in grave danger from the Screaming Two Skulls, who will soon overrun, enslave and then eat them all. The First To Eat clan are potential allies against the merciless Pig Faced Orcs that lair further in the labyrinth. Reaping Madkin, the First To Eat shaman has a pact with the Mushroom King, who provides hallucinogenic mushrooms in return for rotten logs. The shaman believes the mushrooms gives him visions of the future and in one such vision some months ago he saw a band of outsiders defeat goblins from his tribe before turning their might on the Screaming Two Skulls. He will bargain with adventurers, if they have fought the Purple Bruise clan and been victorious telling them what he knows of the level in exchange for an agreement to deal with the Screaming Two Skulls, whose location he knows roughly. The shaman knows about the Mushroom caves and the Beetle herder. He can direct them to the Orange Tree and warn them about the elementals as well as tell them where the Angry Owlbear is.

While the Purple Bruise and First To Eat clan leaders are fighting a cold war against each other, the rank and file freely mix and often swap sides depending on who has less work and more food. If the party are winning against one group, the others will know about it and react accordingly, most likely becoming better organised and bolstering their defences with snipers and traps. The DM is advised to have the goblins take pot shots at them, lead them into traps and generally become more organised as the party overcomes their lairs.  

Goblins of the Grubby Dog tribe enjoy having lots of pockets and occasionally have items of worth in them. Roll 1d8 on the Goblin Pockets table to see what a goblin is carrying, adding the HD-1 of the goblin to the roll. Goblin runts are not powerful or crafty enough to keep hold of items, so don't roll for them.

1.      Dried rats tails, beetle shells, a brass wheel, part-boiled sprouts or shriveled eyes.
2.      Moldy bread, 6 arrow heads, 6 iron spikes or a pair of small lenses.
3.      Tough string, 3 tiny bells or useless keys.
4.      Liquorish roots, hard boiled eggs or a small jar of cooked beans.
5.      1d10 copper pieces

47. Device Of Blades : moving barricade, goblins
Ahead of you is 10 foot wide corridor that appears to end in a wooden wall with various blades and spikes protruding from it towards out. You immediately realise that the wall is mobile and starting to rush towards you!

The goblins have converted an old cart they captured, boarded up the back end and drove all manner of rusty swords and daggers through the wood. They use this when anyone opens the doors to the main corridor that they don’t like. The wooden wall has enough gaps in it for the goblins to easily spot intruders and the carts harnesses have be re-purposed to allow goblins to push it. 

The cart can only travel as far as the door and is relatively easy to avoid, unless of course the players are being chased into the corridor. However to get passed the adventurers need to hack and move around the wood for a round, making them vulnerable to attacks from the goblins behind.

If the characters faced down the cart, they are attacked at +2 doing 1d12 damage. It’s very difficult to get passed, and takes two combat rounds before a character can engage in hand to hand combat, during which they’ll be peppered by arrows.

48. Eastern Shooting Gallery

This odd shaped and tidy area is decorated by recently painted naive but attractive landscape drawings on the wall. Light floods in through arrow slights in the western wall illuminating rows of hay beds, pots and what appears to be paints. Four goblins clutch crossbows, bolts aimed at you, stand in the far corner of the room.

One of the goblins here is responsible for the paintings and the group are rather proud of him and his work. If the characters immediately compliment them on the work they may react in a friendly manner. Otherwise they’ll loose their arrows at the lead character in unison and cry out for support from 49 who will arrive in 2 rounds.

49. More Archers
Mold and damp have permeated the walls of this rooms and an immediate unpleasant musky smell hits your nostrils. Light from overgrown arrow slits provides some illumination. More goblins cower in towards the back of the room, bows half-heartedly drawn.

The goblins here are have been using a corner of their room for their toilet.

50. Goblin Reinforcements
The chamber appears to be a guard room, with tables, bunks and sword racks. Several goblins are here reaching for their weapons, and it seems you have disturbed an unpleasant game of chance involving dice, hammers and live mice. 

The goblins here are lead by a seasoned under boss and will attack the party to the best of their abilities. Hidden in one of the bunks is a gaudy, but gold and pearl earring worth 150 gp. The small door in the north east corner is badly hidden behind and any search of the room will reveal it on DC 12 perception check. The unlocked door and corridor are roughly cut, narrow and low hanging. A dwarf or anyone with similar experience will identify it as a fairly recent addition.

51. Guards
Entry into this chamber reveals a barren, whitewashed room that’s seen better days. Unpleasant stains splash the walls and great stretches are pealing off to review lurid ritual art. Six well armed goblins occupy the room and seem to be mustering for a fight.

2 Goblin skull cleavers (AC 6/14, HD 1+1, hp 6, At 1d8, Mv 90/30, Sv F1, Mr 7, Al CE) Humanoid

52. Unused sleeping area
You enter into a vacant chamber. It seems to be used as sleeping quarters as many straw pallets occupy the floor. The walls in here are mouldering yellow ochre and faint artwork seems to depict worship of an elder grain goddess. A wooden plaque nailed to the door in the south has goblin-scrawl symbols on it.

Nothing of value will be found by searching, save for a variety of attractively coloured insects. Anyone who can read goblin knows the sign says ‘Hall Of Noshing’. Depending on what’s going on in the hall beyond, the characters maybe able to hear goblins through the door.
 
53. Hall of Noshing
This large room serves the goblins as their main hall, where the eat, fight and snooze as a community. Either pick an event or roll for what's going on right now.

Empty : 
The doors open into a large, smokey chamber. Rough tables and benches are scattered about a smouldering firepit in the centre of the room, and the remains of food and drink are scattered on the floor. The chamber is eerily quiet considering it’s size.

Snoozing : This is only the case if the party enter quietly, otherwise the goblins will be waking up. 
The doors open into a large, smokey chamber. Rough tables and benches are scattered about a smouldering firepit in the centre of the room, and the remains of food and drink are scattered on the floor. A number of goblins are also strewn around the room, some sleeping while sitting at the tables, but most have curled up on floor. The sound of snoring and mumbling spike the smokey gloom. 

There are 1d6 warriors, 1d6 archers, 1d4 stabbers and 3d4 runts sleeping off an banquet here. They’ll wake groggily, −1 to all rolls in the first 3 rounds of combat if the party attacks.   

Merriment : Behind the doors you can hear the sounds of many goblins raising their voices in merriment. Bawdy goblin songs, shouting and laughter ring out. 

The room beyond is large and smokey, with a fire pit in the centre and numerous low benches and chairs set out chaotically. Steaming cauldrons and dubious flagons of ale throw out strong aromas. Dozens of goblins sit or stand around, some on the tops of benches, singing goblin songs badly. At the far end of the room a goblin sits brooding atop of wooden throne, flanked by heavily armed warriors.  

There are 1d6 warriors, 1d6 archers, 1d4 stabbers and 4d4 runts joining in the party, while the goblin king, Grodsnuk and 4 goblin skull cleavers sit at the back.

54. Goblin living quarters




55. Snezak The Horned’s room
Somewhere in Snezaks bloodline is something a little devilish, and he has inherited his horns and fire magic from his devilish lineage. He acts as the kings warlord, and is always accompanied by goblin skull cleavers. He has little interest in rule, and is generally given whatever he wants by the king. If the King aligns with the party Snezak will vocally against the plan, and if the party shows any weakness or failure will seek to overthrown the king, kill the PCs and place another king in charge.

60. Guards of the King
Shriekers
61. Reaping Madkin’s lair
62. King Grodsnik Heart Chewer’s abode
63. Chamber of silence
A great enchantment makes this room utterly silent. No noise, however loud can be heard or made in or from it. The goblins find this room too eerie to use, so they turned it into a store room for junk. The goblins therefore haven’t found the secret door, which the Star Trap gnomes use to spy on them from time to time. 
64. Hidden treasures
This hidden door leads to a small chamber which appears to have had some sort of fire or explosion in it judging by the scorch marks obscuring the walls. A blackened skeleton lies next to an open chest that seems to have retained it’s content and contains gold, jewellery and what looks like a potion bottle.

The chest is not trapped and the characters are free to take the treasure. Mixed in with the gold is large amounts of copper coins. The monetary treasure works out to 80 gold pieces and 400 copper. There are some simple pieces of jewelry worth 75 g.p., 50 g.p. and two worth 25 g.p., Also sticking out is a potion of healing.  
The gnomes leave this treasure here in the hope that it’ll distract the curious from searching for the second secret door that leads to their watch post on this level. The potion is here for emergencies also.

            <Text>Running a Star Trap Dungeon campaign

Star Trap Dungeon is aimed at groups wishing to play in the more whimsical and deadly style of the earlier days of old school roleplaying games. New adventurers are less young heroes and more ordinary folk in search of tremendous wealth by risking death at every turn. The monsters that inhabit the depths can be beyond the strengths of the party when they first encounter them. The traps here are often deadly and the specter of cursed magical items also appears to afflict the unwary. While the background to the dungeon and the reasoning behind it's inhabitants residencies tend to have some cohesion, there are places that exist that seem to make little sense. If you and your players need a reason, blame it on the waves of reality bending madness that sometimes roll out from the Obelisk.   

Dungeon Masters are encouraged to have their players create truly random characters. This can be achieved by rolling using the standard method of rolling 4d6 and keeping the best 3 dice rolls for attributes, but rolling them in order of the ability scores as they appear on the character sheet. From this players can construct characters that are unusual to their common preferences and with bonuses that don't always fit archetypes, e.g. dwarves with high charisma, sickly paladins, etc,. Parties will take odd shapes too, for example groups that consist of mostly thieves will benefit from hit and run tactics, while a party of fighters can spend a great deal of time adventuring before having to rest. Natural selection may end up balancing things out as weak or unwanted characters are less likely to survive, through suicidal risk taking or their impractical and ill-suited nature. Allow characters to be swapped if the players want to, let them hire henchman or recruit companions.

Star Trap Dungeon is a living city for those who dwell in it. Loose alliances are formed between distant groups and powerful leaders will often suffer weaker allies that they know about living in their vicinity rather than taking these areas for themselves and having to spread their own number thin. Better the devils you know than the demons you don't is a common saying amongst the dungeon legions. With this co-existence comes trade and travel, so the party can expect to meet various clans out wandering from their own bases. Of course there are unremitting predators that hunt the miles of corridors too and to them the characters are a food source just like any other.

The huge main hallways, usually 20ft both wide and tall, floored in ancient and seemingly self repairing checkered tiles, serve as main roads through the dungeon and are used extensively to travel up and down the levels. Beasts know to avoid them as inhabitants who might otherwise be enemies will quickly join together to kill or repel serious threats to their highways. The party should be wary traveling along these routes too, as creatures from the depths maybe about their business in regions higher up than normal in these areas. A party of first level adventurers make tasty and easy work for a band of trolls returning from an outdoor hunt.  

It's not an exact science judging when to make checks for these wandering monsters, however as a rule of thumb you might consider rolling a d6 once every 30 minutes of actual play. A 1 indicates a random encounter or wandering monster is nearby. Given that encounters can take a hour, you can roll twice after an encounter to see if the fighting has drawn the attention of other dungeon dwellers. However it's advised that you don't check after a wandering monster encounter as it can lead to a chain of encounters without any exploration occurring. As always use intuition over dice rolls, if the party are in a chamber that was extremely difficult to get into, or that has laid undiscovered for centuries there is no reason for wandering monster to find it straight away.</Text>

            <Title>Crawling Warrens (66-76) </Title>
            <Text>Region seven - Crawling Warrens (66-76)
The bizarre tunnels between rooms in this area are unlike anywhere else on this level, being cylindrical rather than rectangular in shape. The appear, and indeed may have been, eaten out of the rock be huge worms rather than carved by the elementals and other workers who built much of the dungeon. A lone Farspawn Returned who coalesced in the dungeon because of the obelisk wanders these tunnels, building crude traps and adding to it's hideous art gallery. Other sinister forces once lived here and their influence too can be found. The DM is encourage to pick their moment well when the Returned attacks, and perhaps retreat before it is properly seen for the first encounter. The Farspawn Returned is a dangerous foe for low level characters, however it might not last long in a stand up fight.

Farspawn Returned (AC 4/16, HD 4, At 1d4/1d4/1d6, Mv 90/30, Sv F2 Mr 12, Al CE) Aberration
Attacks with two claws and a bite. The returned has the abilities of a 4th level thief and also may cast confusion once a day as a 10ht level magic user. It may use it’s backstab ability on all it’s attacks when able to do so.

66. Goblin Corpse Montage
A repugnant sight greets you in middle of this twisting corridor. A tree, made from what looks like limbs and torsos of goblins reaches up almost to ceiling. It is adorned with shrivelled heads, hung like apples from the branches of the construction. 

The goblins bodies are decomposing and some are in an advanced stage of rot. 

67. The Smiling Skulls Trap
Otherwise unremarkable, the odd shaped area has a huge skull motif covering much of the ceiling. As you look up further you realise that skull pattern itself is made up from real skulls. Several different races are represented in the artwork, if that’s what it can be called. As you stare up at them, you also notice the glint of gold.

The skulls that form the eye sockets appear to have been blackened with fire and they themselves have gold pieces jammed into their eye sockets. Somehow the Returned has trapped this coins so that if coins are removed the skulls all tumble to the floor and explode in necrotic fire when they hit anything. Anyone standing beneath the mural, is struck by blast of negative energy and fire, doing 1d10 negative energy damage and 1d10 fire damage. Save versus breath weapons for half damage. 

There are 60 gold coins in total. 

68. Hidden Map Room
This circular chamber is empty and feels very ancient. A thick layer of grime covers all the floors celling and walls, although the source isn’t clear.

The grime covers a map that was painted onto the walls long before the collapse of the Mushroom King area. Most notable on this map is room mark in archaic common as leading to the tomb of Judder (area 46 on the dungeon map). It also depicts a chair or throne in that chamber. The teleportation magic that should take the characters to the Tomb has failed, unless the DM wants to transport the players there. 

This is a map room, and if the dungeon master wishes they may link maps and paintings to other 3rd party places. 
HANDOUT - Map painting showing teleport to tomb of Judder

69. Starchamber
The dominant feature of this round room, carved out of the rock like one half of a sphere is the star map painted on the curved surface. It’s old and in places the paint as peeled, but you can recognise some well known constellations and disturbing a few that are utterly alien to you. There is a strange and out of place sense of eerie peace here compared to the other chambers in this section of the dungeon. 

Star pact warlocks, or anyone who is interested in astronomy can make observations about the star patterns on an arcana DC of 12. Star pact warlocks who spend time in here, at least 15 minutes, contemplating the stars find the veil lies between them and their patrons is thin here. They regain the use of daily power because of this, although re-powering can only take place once a day. However the thinness of reality also means that contact might draw an aberrant creature from the far realm. There is 1 in 6 chance that something steps through, once the Warlock has regain their power. On d8 1-4 results in 1d4 Dimension Shamblers, 5-7 results in 1d4 Grell Stranglers and on an 8 a single Grick steps out from the walls. All will attack the party immediately.   


70. Chamber Of Black Tentacles 
You’ve reached what appears to be a cross roads of tunnels, and for once the floor is fairly even. The south wall has be carved flat and is dominated by a large imposing double iron door. Decals depict skulls, demons and abstract symbols, while the frame has been carved to appear as if sharp stone teeth protrude from the stone. Door knockers, shaped like winged skulls add to the grotesque appearance. 

The door is locked and trapped, anyone attempting to knock or open the door in any other way without saying the password, a long lost and forgotten phrase, will be attacked by horrible black tentacles that appear out of the wall.

10 Horrible Black Tentacles (AC 5/15, HD 1, Hps 1, At 1d6 + slow, Mv special, Sv F1, Mr 12, Al N) Aberration, Minion
Successful hits by the black tentacles cause the target to be slowed as per the spell. Tentacles cannot travel on their own and are anchored in place by the magic that summoned. However they are 20 feet long end to end so can reach far from their anchor point.


71. Dead Larvae
Giant insect larvae have been killed, preserved and arranged in spiral patterns. Undead wraith maggots. 
72. Rotting Oranges
Several rotting oranges from the magical orange tree. The Returned collects them, but can’t eat them.  
73. Awaiting Room
Magical symbols adorn this chamber, carved from green soapstone. They repel intruders and cause fear.
74. The Long Dead Wizard
The bones of a long dead wizard crumble on a chair in this chamber that appears to be both a workshop and sleeping area. A trapped minor demon will plead to be release and will serve for a year and a day it’s rescuer. Magic items, rituals. 
75. Weapons Racks
Huge rusting battle handed cleavers and mauls line this chamber
76. Chamber Of Bones
This room is filled waste high in ancient a brittle bones. Travelling through is painful for the unarmed, as well as unsettling.</Text>

To rectify this modify saving throw roll the wizard makes against spells cast by other wizards by the plus of the staff or wand they carry.

            <Text>Experience points and buying training.
Traditionally many DM’s who have given out experience points for treasure have done so immediately upon finding it. As an optional rule, don’t. Instead PC’s must spend money on training to gain these experience points. This makes slightly more sense than the traditional method, and means that players must make the choice between buying new equipment, and later abodes, and going up levels. To stop turning perpetual money-making schemes produce high level characters, 10% of all experience per level must come from other sources than training. Thus a first level thief who wishes to go up a level must gain at least 125 xp from adventuring, but can spend 1125 g.p. in loot to train up to 2nd.</Text>

            <Title>Star Trap Gnomes (77)</Title>
            <Text>Star Trap Gnomes
77. Star Trap Gnomes 
The Star Trap Gnomes are an clan of gnomes that have lived and been changed by the dungeon over the coarse of hundreds of years. Their immense stealth and natural invisibility means they have travelled vast swaths of the dungeon without ever being notice. In the background they help maintain the status quo within it’s depths and have seen many factions, and many adventuring parties, rise and fall. Occasionally they will aid some against others. Their real power base is many levels down, but they maintain outposts on each level and secret caches of magic and treasure to use as they see fit.

Two Star Trap Gnomes are currently living on the first level and relatively inexperienced. While they see the Pig-Faced orcs are dangerous, they assume that they will blow themselves out quite quickly if they grow confident enough to descend further into the dungeon. They hope though that the orcs might be strong enough to destroy the necromantic device of Thandrak The Black before they do and are scheming to make that happen. They don’t care much for the goblins who they consider a pest, but consider the Myconids to be a benign addition the dungeon ecosystem.     
 
The Gnomes dress in large black cloaks with deep, pointed hoods. They move silently and appear almost to float across the ground, and actually some of the more powerful Gnomes levitate naturally at will. 

Running the Star Trap Gnomes
Helpful
The Gnomes may decide that the adventurers are able to defeat the necromantic device, in which case they’ll likely sneak a message to the party, warning them of the danger but indicate that treasures can be found in the secret chambers. At this point they Gnomes are unlikely to actual contact with the party unless discovered. 
Harmful
The Gnomes have decided that the adventurers are reckless at best and dangerous at worst and thwart them at odd times. This may include theft and backstabbing but it’s more likely that they will lead one wander monster into the path of the party after another.
Disdainful
The Gnomes will ignore the party and do everything they can to hide from them. Given their stealth this is most likely. They won’t begrudge, yet, the adventurers looting their cache if the adventurers find their hidden chambers, although they might somehow warn them off from messing with the gnomes in future. 

The Room Itself
Behind the cunning secret door is a large and well furnished room. A set of 5 comfortable, if small, beds line two walls, while a worktop along another appears to used as a kitchen, with several jugs and foodstuffs left out, you notice some of which are fresh and half eaten. From another wall pegs hold short, heavy black cloaks. Strange metal tubes run along parts of walls and a large chest also holds your interest.

Monster types.

Animal 
Animals refer to mundane creatures, usually mammal or reptile. They have low intelligence and cannot speak. 

Magical Animal
Animals that have been magically transformed are not uncommon in Star Trap. In most regards they are like animals. 

Lesser Demon
Demons come from a chaotic and violent dimension sometimes know as the Abyss. They are universally evil and chaotic. They also relish the chance to enter into the material realm and cause havoc. Some work to this end directly, while others tempt wizards into summoning them and perverting them to do acts of harm. 

Lesser Demons are immune to disease and resistant to poison, fire and cold. They gain +3 to poison saves and take half damage from fire and cold. While they have their own language, they can generally speak any language they wish. They also have darkvision. 

Insect
Insects have very low, instinctive intelligence. They usually enjoy lowlight vision. 

Undead
Spirits that have either failed to enter the realm of the dead or have been summoned back are very often malign and hateful of the living. Depending on the strength of will undead go from being of low intelligence to supra-geniuses. They are immune to mind effecting spells such as charm and suggestion. Undead also take 1d8 points of damage per level of the creator from being splashed by holy or blessed water.  

Aberration
Aberrations are beings from the horror dimensions that exist at the furtherest edges of reality. They some how interface with the dreams of those who come from the material realm, are related to star beings and astronomy. They come is sizes from tiny to unimaginably vast. Because of their alien nature they are immune to mind affecting spells.  

Fungoid
Fungoids are neither plants or animals. They often thrive in dump, warm and poorly lit conditions like those found in dungeons. Spells that affect plants or animals only do not work on fungoid creatures. 

Ooze
Oozes are strange creatures, displaying magical, animal, plant and fungoid attributes. They are almost always non-intelligent and ever hungry for organic material to consume. They are immune to mind affecting spells universally and often have other immunities too. 

Minion
Minions make up many of the armies from below. While the fight just as well as others in their band, they are weak, fall injured, flee or feign death after the first solid hit they receive and only have 1 hit point for game purposes. However they don’t take any damage from things like spells that cause half on a successful save, as long as they make that save of course.   

Angry Owlbear (AC 5/15 HD 5, hp 25, At +4 1d8/1d8/1d6 or screech, Mv 60/20,SV F5 Mr 8, Al N) Magical Animal

May switch each turn between Goblin king and wolf form. In Goblin king form they may cast Protection from Good 10’r at will. In wolf form they may cast Invisibility once a day. +1 Battle axe. 
Barghests are demonic shapeshifters from the nether planes. They feed and grow on the souls of the good. This is just a younger one.

When in danger fire beetle pump chemicals into their head and body that cause them to appear to burning up inside, and make their bite extremely hot. These gland may be removed from a dead beetle and used as an unquenchable torch for 1d6 days.

Beetle, Boring (AC 3/17, HD 5, Hp 22, At +4 5d4, Mv 60/20, Sv F5, Mr 7 Al N) Insect
Boring beetles are huge, 9 feet long and dark blue with rainbow sheen. It’s mouthpart is a riot of hooks and mandibles, but apart from that they are nothing special.

The Brain is a 5th level wizard, and can cast the following spells: Charm Person x2, Unseen Servant, Amnesia, Ray Of Enfeeblement, Suggestion. The Jar acts as a Broach Of Shield with 101 charges.

He can use the Unseen Servant to throw objects that have +0 to hit and do 1d4 damage if they strike the target, up to a range of 20 ft feet away.
Insane, paranoid, ego-manical and delusional the brain in a jar is more fun to play with than a box full of kittens.

Dimension Shambler (AC 7/13, HD 2, Hp 9, At +1 1d4/1d4, Mv 90/30, Sv F1, Mr 9, Al CN) Aberration
May cast Dimension Door at will.
Dimension shamblers appear as gorilla-like bundles of ropes and tentacles. They seem not to recognise a difference between intelligent beings, flora and beasts, consuming whatever they come across. There common modus operandi is to appear in groups both in front and behind of their victims. Stargazers postulate that they do not digest food but transport to whatever horror dimension they come from for something else to eat.

Attacks with two claws and a bite. The returned has the abilities of a 4th level thief and also may cast confusion once a day as a 10ht level magic user. It may use it’s backstab ability on all it’s attacks when able to do so.
It’s inevitable that people find an entrance to the Far Realm, but when they make it back it’s a rare event indeed and they are utterly, and chillingly changed. Madness, many eyes, and horrible purple rubbery skin marks them apart from who they might have once been.

Farspawn Mind Worm (AC 5/15, HD 1, Hp 4, At +0 1pt*, Mv 90/30 Levitation, Sv F1 Mr 12, Al CE) Aberration
Lamprey-like bite attack, if successful the victim must save versus mind effecting spells or lose 1d4 points of Wisdom for 2d4 turns, roll only once for duration. If reduced to below 3, the victim goes insane, attacking friend or foe at random. After the first round this wisdom drain is automatic, but does no further hit point loss.
Imagine a floating 4 foot sea-worm, covered in eyes, each oddly sad seeming.   

Farspawn Teeth Eel (AC 4/16, HD 2, Hp 12, At +1 1d6, Mv 90/30 Levitation, Sv F1 Mr 12, Al CE) Aberration
Gnawing bite attack.

Gelatinous Cube (AC 8/12, HD 4, hp 16, At +3 2d4, Mv 60/20, Sv F1, Mr 8, Al N) Ooze
Surprise on a 2+. Save vs paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds, during which the cube engulfs the opponent and automatically does it’s acid damage.

            <Text>Forgotten Chambers Of Ancient Seers (31-34)

31. Star Constellation Trap : constellations, trap

The corridor behind the hidden door is dusty and the air feels old and stale. The hallway ends in three great sets of double doors, one straight ahead and the other two facing north and south. Crafted from ancient oak and steel, these doors are covered in a patchwork of dials of various sizes. Upon the outer rim of each dial is set one or more moonstones. Given the layers of dust it seems that nobody has opened these doors in an age.

Each door can only be opened if the moonstones align to form the correct star constellation. Characters who are involved in astrology will probably make the connection easily. If the wrong constellation is displayed will cause a trap to go off. Thieves may disarm trap and allow the door to open. Any attempt to open a door that hasn't been unlocked causes the 10 feet square area in front of the doors to be filled with lightning. Anyone in this area is subject to psychic attack doing 6d6 damage, save vs spells for half. It's also possible for the players to buy a map of the stars (40 g.p.) that will make disarming the trap and unlocking the door easily. Such a map maybe hard to find or expensive. Note the ceiling of room 15 is painted to represent the constellation of the Unicorn and opens the door to 32. The door to room 33 requires the constellation of the Sleeping Beast, while the the door to 34 needs the constellation of the Axe. 

32. The Cloak Room : Obelisk key, clock

This chamber is clean, although the air is also stale. The magical door kept the dust at bay and everything in here seems almost held in stasis. A wooden rack on the south wall is covered in pegs and from ten of these hang midnight blue cloaks, all perfectly clean and unblemished. A long desk runs across the west wall and apart from a strange looking key it is empty. The key is large, angular and looks like it is made from smokey glass.

The cloaks, woven from thick silk, all radiate a little magic (level 1) and were the attire of members of the Toolizith Coven when abroad from their bases within the dungeon. They give a +1 item bonus to saves vs spells and are considered a neck slot item like other cloaks. The key is also magical and unbreakable, it's one of the Obelisk keys that can open the doors to the Obelisk of Insanity on various levels.

33. Storeroom : mural, note
The long abandoned chamber has a large number of shelves that line the walls and suggest that this may have been a store room or even library once. The ceiling has a faded mural on it that depicts a large block of stone that radiates waves which seem to touch be groups of figures who stand as listening. Long perished rations perhaps make up the the dust detritus on most of the shelves, although it looks like a few pieces of paper also linger.

The torn note, written in an archaic form of common reads "Kvinkel, if you read this note my love we have fled down our hidden stair. The attacks of the Outers grow and Hermistus believes we will be safer in our stronghold, but we have heard nothing from below in days. Save yourself, forget our work and get out into the daylight. I will not forget you, Lavindal."

34. The Stairwell : trapdoor, beds, ghost

What appears to long forgotten beds and tables moulder in this large chamber. Set before the north wall is a heavy and ironshod double trapdoor, no doubt leading into deeper regions of the dungeon. A sturdy bar seals the way. 

The beds and tables are crumbling and of no value. The appear to have been about six beds, that would have been for roughly human sized occupants. 

If the bar is moved, the characters can lift open the double doors revealing a spiral stairway leads down into the darkness. The skeleton of a human or half elf lies someway down and a ghost haunts the stairs who reveals some information about the Toolizth Coven before attempting to push characters down the stairs. The stairs leads to subsection of the 2nd level. Trap.</Text>

            <Text>Stat checks
Throughout these description there are notes on making stat checks. These usually take the form ‘Roll x+ on d6 + stat’ this means the player needs to roll a d6 adding their stat bonus, and must score x or more to succeed. Players and DM are encouraged to think reasons why the player maybe better or worse at a particular roll. For example elves examining elven poetry to discern a magical trap might get a racial bonus of +1. If fact you might want to make note of what things a player character is good and bad at as time goes on to build up a more detailed profile of the PC.

            <Text>Alternative AD&amp;D combat rules.

Armour class goes up instead of down. To find the new value of an original style armour class use 20 - AC. Thus AC 3 becomes AC 17 and AC -2 becomes AC 22. When rolling to hit a foe, use this value as the target. 

To hit bonuses instead of to hit score. This removes the need for to hit tables and uses the following formula based on class or hit dice.

Monsters = HD -1 So an Orc has +0 to hit. However additional pluses to hit points indicate an additional +1, that Hobgoblins with 1+1 HD get a +1 to hit. However a monster with 3+3 hit dice is only +3 as they only ever get a +1 from having additional pluses. The reverse is true for negative monster hit points, so goblins at 1-1 HD have a -1 to hit. Fractional hitpoints also count as -1.

Fighters, rangers, paladins and monks get their level as a bonus. Clerics, druids, thieves and assassins get half their level rounded down as a bonus, Magic-users and illusionists get a third of their level rounded down as a bonus.</Text>

Otherwise weapons can be employed, hitting automatically and requiring 12 hps total of damage to allow entry. Some doors are individually described as they are stronger or weaker.

Some encounter or groups include variations on how to run them, mostly defined as helpful, harmful or disdainful. This idea, stolen shamelessly from Robin D. Laws’ Armitage Files book, allows a GM to tailor the pace and style of the dungeon to the needs of her group. Do the PC’s need allies? Use the helpful variant. Are the players mostly interested in fighting? Use the harmful one. Do you want to introduce some themes, or knowledge but want to retain the chance to fight the monsters later? Use the disdainful version.

            <Text>Running The Grubby Dogs
Helpful
The goblins of the Purple Bruise clan are less likely to aid the party in any capacity as their leader is a psychopathic creature, so there is little chance of immediate help from them. However the goblins on his side may be ready for a new leader and characters could be directed into defeating the Barghest without struggling through the entire complex. Nadso the goblin hexer might be behind such a coup, and send goblins out to the parley with the party.
The First To Eat are much more likely to seek an alliance with the party, as their shaman has foretold of just such a group defeating the hated Screaming Two Skulls orcs. Having the party prove themselves by overthrowing Horse Gutter will give the party experience enough to journey further into the dungeon. As allies the goblins aren’t a great deal of use, although they could provide crude maps to some areas, details the inhabitants and possibly provide goblin treasure-bearers.  
Harmful
After an assault on the tribe by the party the goblin leaders thrown in their lot with each other and start cooperating. This leads to ambushes, makeshift traps and the potential of the goblins leading the wandering monsters of the level into combat with the party. This will continue until the shaman Reaping Madkin is sufficiently convinced that the party or the saviours he dreamed about. However the Purple Bruise clan will trick the party into believing them allies all the while planning to ambush them when they are most vulnerable. 
Disdainful
The goblins see the party as any other competitor for the limited pickings found in the dungeon. When encountered they will attack if they feel they are likely to surprise or overwhelm the character and flee if not. Cornered goblins might barter for their lives with small bits of information they have gleaned about the dungeon.</Text>

            <Title>Horse Gutter's domain (1-16)</Title>
            <Text>Region one - Horse Gutter's domain
1. Long entrance corridor : door, smell, goblins, murals
The door to Horse Gutter's domain is barred from the inside. If the door is smashed in it will be repaired and reinforced if the majority of Horse Gutter's goblins still live between extended rests, at which point the check to break the barricade in becomes 6+ on a D6+Str and 12 hps to be open again. Smashing in the door will alert those inside. It is possible to bluff or use diplomacy to get the doors open, both require talking in Goblin and 5+ on a D6+Chr. Intimidation will only cause the goblins to get reinforcements, who may even scale down the outside and ambush the party from two sides.

This long 10 feet wide corridor is both rubbish strewn and smelly. The floor is hewed stone and painted murals on the walls seem to depict ranks of bowmen raining arrows down on fleeing knights. Your torches pick out the forms of several green-skinned short and crooked humanoids all with overlarge ragged and pointy ears. They are clutching weapons and mustering to attack! 

A 4+ on D6+Int or Wis check, or being a Dwarf will identify the smell and trappings of goblins, although this maybe obvious given the guards who keep watch here. Unless the party have already made a name for themselves amongst the goblin tribe, the warriors here believe they are up to the task of fighting off the adventurers and thus the rewards of picking the through the bodies of their kill for food, treasures and weapons. Tactically the goblins warriors will charge forward and attack, but shift back if possible to avoid potential counter attacks. The acolyte will scream orders and use ranged attacks, pushing back any who get through the warrior ranks. The sharpshooter will continue to launch arrows until closed in on, when it will attempt to flee towards the guard room in room 8. The debris has nothing of value hidden amongst it and is made up of discard bones, mud and leaves. The goblins in room 8 are likely to make an appearance after 3 or 4 rounds, especially if they can slip behind the party if the goblins here have retreated.

4 goblin warriors, 1 goblin archer, 1 goblin acolyte. 
Goblin warrior (AC 6/14, HD 1-1, hp 4, At 1d6, Mv 90/30, Sv 0h, Mr 7, Al CE) Humanoid

May cast randomly 1-2 Command, 3-4 Curse, 5-6 Cause Fear once per day. May use devices as a cleric.  Sacred club, ritual dagger.



 
2. Shooting gallery : goblins, boss, windows, rope

Awkwardly shaped but well lit, this chamber seems to contain living quarters and occupants as straw beds, stools and a table are apparent. Daylight streams in from two windows set into the eastern wall, making silhouettes of the handful of goblins standing before you and who are holding bows or other weapons ready. Crude skulls are daubed near the windows and seemed ranked against what might be names. 

Several goblin creatures armed with hunting bows lurk in darker parts of the room, led by a large and unsavoury goblin armed with a black iron battle axe and well used shield. 

Ungully Headbreaker, a mean and hated underboss lairs here. He is in charge of shooting down anything or anyone approaching the dungeon entrance that doesn't seem too powerful. He never orders attacks on those who exit the dungeon, fearing retribution from below. He has a wary respect for the bowmen of the First To Eat clan and they generally share the spoils of animals or others that the two groups manage to kill out the dungeon, despite orders to the contrary. This is mostly to stop the other side from shooting his bowmen when the go out to fetch kills. He considers himself a tough veteran, who will order his sharpshooters to engage in combat to maximise the others ability to shoot while he picks his moments carefully. Sounds of combat will draw him and his men to the second gallery should the party approach from that direction. He will fight to the death, but if he dies before his followers they will flee towards 4.  
The windows give a good view onto the area before the entrance doors are narrow, but small creatures, such as goblins and halflings can fit through. There are coils of rope around to help with the climb down, should anyone do so succeeds on a 2+ on D6+Dex. 

4 goblin archers, 1 goblin bully with a cheaply jewelled dagger worth 50 gp.

Battleaxe, shield.


 
3. Second gallery : goblins, window
The second gallery is nondescript except for a patch of fresco that shows thin figures dancing around a strange spike of black rock. Two further windows light the chamber and are just big enough to climb out. Rope lies coiled in a corner. 

The goblins here will probably be encountered in the shooting gallery (area 2) or at the guard station (area 4) unless they are surprised. They are universally cowards, so if they think they can get away with not being caught will flee or surrender.

3 goblin archers.

+1 to hit with their short bows due to dexterity adjustment, dagger. Short bow, 1d12 arrows, daggers.


4. Guard station : guards, goblins, bully, flee
This square chamber ends in a heavy wooden door. Goblin drawings litter the walls showing scenes of violence and theft, while ceiling mould makes the room smell musty and damp. Two young looking goblin warriors are proudly clutching knives in defence, while a larger and fatter goblin seems to opening the door behind them.

The guard station is here more to prevent light fingered goblins sneaking into Horse Gutters living area and store rooms than prevent a determined group. If a party appear without masking their approach the goblin bully Sloba Kneeeater will flee towards the Awaiting chamber (area 6) after commanding the young, brave and stupid runts to stop them. Sloba knows about the pit trap at 5. and will avoid it.
4 goblin runts, 1 goblin bully

5. Horse Gutters entrance way : gruesome, rug, trap, pit, skeletons

This small chamber is furnished with numerous heads on poles, Skulls stacked in pile, while foul smelling incense fills the place with smoke and moth-eaten rugs line the entire floor. Badly cast bells line the walls with ropes made from strips of leather and horse hair. Two severed horses heads on poles frame a large double door, rotting away and attracting flies.

The entrance way to Horse archers inner chambers. The bells are to be used by any wishing an interview with the Barghest. In front of the actual doorway is a false floor pit trap which collapses if approach directly. A 5+ on d6+Dex check is required to spot it. The pit beneath is 15 ft deep and half filled with bones, the fall causing 1d6+1. Two Skeletons have animated spontaneously over the years and will attack anyone who falls in. Previous victims have left behind 95 g.p., a leather pouch contain 2 small bars of silver worth 10 g.p. each, 2 short swords and a small well made metal shield.

Double damage from smashing weapons, half damage from slashing and piercing. Hand weapon.


6. Awaiting chamber : goblins, wizard, wolf, arcane symbols, chair, wand
Vivid purple and green runes and arcane symbols cover the walls of this large chamber. A chair of unusual design sits throne-like against one wall while threadbare rugs are laid out to mimic those of a royal chamber. The goblin inhabitants, seven in total, are bolstered by a large grey wolf that growls at you. The goblin sat on the chair appears to wear robes suited to a wizard, an image enhanced by the wand he holds, that glows with a white flame.

Nadso Wildbiter, the crafty goblin hexamancer who lives here lords it over anyone wishing to to visit Horse Gutter, whom he acts as chamberlain. He is something of a coward and is reluctant to leave this chamber so is very unlikely to move to engage the party even if the goblins hear fighting from elsewhere. Nadso is the one who has covered the room in what he claims are arcane runes and symbols using purple and green inks, but they are mostly just random lines and circles, an arcane DC of 15 reveals that that are mostly fake and those at are true magical symbols have no power. However it impresses the others and it is generally believed by the tribe that Nadso can detect lies spoken here because of them. Nadso might strike a deal with a party that scares him, but otherwise believes his powers and allies are more than equal to the task of killing the characters. Nadso is somewhat susceptible to flattery (diplomacy or bluff) but will work to betray the adventurers to the betterment of himself. Nadso is armed with a +1 wand of magic missiles with 5 charges.
1 wolf, 1 goblin hexer, 3 goblin warriors, 3 goblin runts.

7. Hexer's chamber : wizard’s lair, potion, poison, spell book, gold

A crude wizard’s lair has been set up in this long chamber. Workbenches covered in tubes, animal remains, pentagrams, odd devices and bubbling pots line the walls and a nest of straw and blankets rests against the far wall. The smell is almost toxic and stings your eyes a little.

This is Nadso's lair, where he performs research and indulges his deprivations. In typical fashion the place is a mess, crude work benches littered with paraphernalia which Nados thinks might improve his magical abilities are haphazardly arrange here. Half filled potions, glass beakers filled with eyes, dried bats, shorn rat pelts, crude pentagrams and hexagrams can all be found in amongst the debris. On the table is a potion of healing and an identical looking potion of Sludge Lung poison (drinking causes automatic save versus poison at -2, causing 1d8 damage per round until saved or dead). Nadso's spellbook contains the spells Detect Magic, Sleep, Hold Portal and Read Magic. The recipe for Sludge Lung poison is also written in Goblin and could be worth 100 g.p. to the right buyer. A rough straw mattress lies in one corner, underneath which lives a multitude of earwigs and also a purse containing 103 g.p. in various denominations.

8. Guard room : guards, goblins, cell, zombie

A bare, twenty foot by twenty foot chamber appears occupied by more goblins. Two small doors line the east wall and rope tied to the furthest doors handle is held at the other end by a goblin barking orders at the others. Only a dice covered table and rickety chairs decorate the place while the walls may have once had frescoes upon them but are fair too faded to make out.

Two warriors in this chamber are likely to join any battle in area 1, while the remaining goblins hold up here protecting to the door to room 9. The acolyte is holding the rope that with a sharp tug opens the door to area 8a, which confines the zombie. He will hold off pulling the rope until the party have engaged and are closer to the door than he is as the zombie will attack the living soul nearest to it. He will then bang on the door to 9 and run inside, looking for aid from the goblins there. The small in the south east is being used as a toilet and stinks unbearable. 

4 goblin warriors, 1 goblin acolyte, 1 zombie in 8a.

Attacks last, critical hit instantly kills it, two successive hits on an opponent means the Zombie does not need to roll to hit and does 1d6 biting damage a round.


9. Quarters : sleeping quarters, cowards, rumours
Strewn with straw beds, stools and other junk this square room seems to be living quarters for goblins, who are rushing about and screaming at you to leave. A few are armed and seem ready to defend themselves, but aren't actually attacking yet. Goblin graffiti covers the walls as high as they can reach however the ceiling has a huge green eye painted on it that stares down at you.

The goblins here, including the acolyte from room 8 will defend themselves, but give the party the chance to talk first. A bluff, diplomacy and intimidation roll of 4+ on a d6+Chr will all reveal some or all of the following information, best gleamed through roleplaying the cowardly conniving goblins.

	1.	This area leads only to more quarters and the kitchen.
	2.	Outsiders shouldn't eat good goblin food as Maglubiyet has cursed it. (lie)
	3.	Their great leader, who will surely eat the party, is called Horse Gutter and can be found by taking the stairs at the far end of the long corridor (area 1).
	4.	They are members of the Grubby Dog Tribe and make up the Purple Bruise clan. The First To Eat clan are on the other side of corridor and are led by Heart Chewer, who will also surely eat the party if they should meet him.
	5.	Both tribal chiefs have great riches, but the cannibal Orcs further in have much more.
	6.	Horse Gutter is stronger than a Troll and casts spells from his eyes (lie).
	7.	Heart Chewer is in league with demons (lie).
	8.	Nadso the goblin wizard will blast you with his wand.

The goblins will not leave their quarters and when the characters leave some of them will follow someway behind, listening out for the sounds of battle. They'll then race to join their fellows, attacking from the rear if possible. If forced to do anything the goblins will swarm in against the apparent leader of the party.

2 goblin warriors, 2 runts.

Goblin warrior (AC 6/14, HD 1-1, hp 4, At 1d6, Mv 90/30, Sv 0h, Mr 7, Al CE) Humanoid

Goblin runts (AC 7/13, HD 1-1, hp 1, At 1d4, Mv 90/30, Sv h0, Mr 6, Al CE) Humanoid
Knife or improvised weapon.

9a. Quarters : rubbish, goblins, goblin children, cowards
More rubbish and bedding swamps this square chamber. The stink of goblin is strong and many mewing and malnourished goblin-brats huddle in the furthest corners with fear in their eyes.

If the characters manage to enter here without raising the alarm then six goblin adults are in attendance. They'll fight to defend their room and the children, but might well flee or offer the brats as slaves if the first round goes against them.
2 goblin warriors, 4 runts.

Knife or improvised weapon.

10. Quarters and shrine : statue, shrine, blessing, amulet, goblins
Again straw beds cover the floors in this red painted square room, however a wooden stand and 2 feet tall crude clay statue are against the far north wall. The statue has goblin-like proportions and a delicate golden chain fixed to some kind of orange amulet is draped around it.

The goblins use this as quarters for the acolytes and a shrine to their prancing god. The statue is of the god, which can be identified on a 3+ rolled on a d6+Wis and is and practically worthless to anyone but followers of the god who count as being blessed as per the spell when standing with 10’ of the statue. Smashing the statue, might curse those who destroy it in some way. The chain is worth 50 g.p. and the amulet is a +1 amulet of protection.
1 goblin acolyte, 1 goblin stabber, 2 archers, 2 runts.

Stabbers have the abilities of a 1st level thief. Daggers and throwing knives.


11. Kitchen and storage : kitchen, cook, goblins
A barrage of noise and smells reaches you before you open the door to this chamber. Unpleasant over boiled food smells, the sounds of shouting goblins and the crash of metal ware to be precise. When you do open the door, the smoke, steam and chaos of a goblin kitchen almost overwhelm you. Goblin's run about everywhere, far more intent on dodgy the swipes of a huge and angry goblin cook, who armed with a cleaver seems to either aiming to make a stew of goblin fingers or brains. Finally he notices you and grins.

This odd shaped chamber is obviously the place the goblins cook. Rows of hanging rats and other even less savory types of meat hang from hooks, while a huge cauldron steams to one side. A large overweight goblin called Ugmol Marrowsucker sees an opportunity to add the PCs to his collection of exotic meats and will command his kitchen staff to attack immediately.
1 underboss, 5 runts. 
Goblin runts (AC 7/13, HD 1-1, hp 1, At 1d4, Mv 90/30, Sv h0, Mr 6, Al CE) Humanoid

Battleaxe, shield.

12. Horse Gutters Chamber : goblin king, wolves, goblins, finery, throne, barghest, treasure, trap
An example of Goblin finery at it's worst decks out this large square chamber, with rugs and animal skins lining the floor and cloaks, shields, skulls and weapons all covering every free space on the walls. A crude but impressive throne sits against the west wall, along with a large wooden treasure chest. A table occupies the centre of the chamber around which two burly goblins converse with a goblin wearing religious icons. However it's the figure sat on the throne that attracts your attention the most, a huge purple hewed massive goblin king with wolf eyes clutching a solid black battleaxe. Two wolves flank him and snarl at you as he starts barking at you.

Horse Gutter is a Barghest and is driven to acts of murder and violence beyond that of normal Goblin chiefs. His ferocity has gained him followers but mostly from fear. He will try to intimidate the characters, but he is crafty enough to know that they must have defeated his guards elsewhere and are not to be underestimated. He might even strike a bargain with the party to attack his rivals or even take on the pig-faced orcs who he fears above all. However his temper is likely to provoke the party into a fight, in which case he will charge anyone who looks like a wizard while the others wear down any fighters. The wolves will stick with Horse Gutter and go after anyone he attacks.

Horse Gutter (Barghest), 2 wolves, 2 goblin skull cleavers, 1 acolyte of Maglubiyet. +1 Battleaxe. In chest, poison dart trap save or take 3d6 damage. +1 Dagger. 2 potions of healing. 1100 g.p. 235 s.p. a bag of 13 small rubies worth 13 g.p. each and a elven jade erotic necklace worth 150 g.p. 

Barghest, Juvenile (AC 4/16, HD 3, hp 14, At 1d8+2 or 1d6+1, Mv 90/30 or 180/60, Mr 10, Al CE) Demon

13. Store room : junk, trap, magic bow
It appears that you have discovered the goblin's junk room. Quantities of goblin weapons and armour, moldy furs, torn leathers, tubs, barrels litter the room, often stacked on what appears to old bunk beds. Strings of dead rats hang from the ceiling, along with bits of chain, rusty cleavers, broken shields and old bones. The smell suggests the room is rarely cleared out and suggests it is sometimes used as a toilet.

This chamber is used by the goblins as store room for arms and armour, wood, leather, food, water and anything else they want to keep but not display. In typical goblin fashion it's an unordered junk pile, some of which is stacked on what appears to be moldy bunk beds or poorly made benches. Searching the room for anything of real value is dangerous, but possibly fruitful. Anyone making a search is subject to a +4 on a d6+Dex check, resulting in 1d8 damage from collapsing weapons stacks and other heavy or sharp things if they fail. However hidden at the very back of the room is are 5 +1 arrows. 
14. Guard post : guards, goblins
Standing to attention outside a pair of reinforced double doors stand two well armed goblins. Your appearance confuses them and they decide the right thing to do is rush you.

2 goblin skull cleavers
Goblin skull cleavers (AC 6/14, HD 1+1, hp 6, At 1d8, Mv 90/30, Sv F1, Mr 7, Al CE) Humanoid
Battleaxe, shield.


15. Forgotten chamber : ancient, star map, moonstones, curse
As you enter the hidden room a huge sense of age overwhelms you. Inside you find as small square room in which the air is stale and only dust remains. Further inspection reveals evidence that once books were stored here, but nothing more than that can be recovered. However the painted ceiling is still vibrant, depicting a darkening nights sky and a shining constellation of seven moonstone stars.

The ceiling is painted with a star constellation that opens the door in area 31 and can be easily copied down. The seven moonstones can be removed if the ceiling is reached, but they carry a magic curse meaning anyone carrying one feels highly emotional and a little paranoid immediately. This manifests in a -2 penalty to saves. If the curse, which was cast at 10th level, is removed the non-magical moonstone is worth 50 g.p.

16. Trapped escape corridor : trap
Describe this corridor as you normally would. Half way along the it a pressure plate releases a two foot thick stone wall from the ceiling that may crash into the the first people who walk along the corridor. A 7+ on a d6+Dex perception check or find traps will spot the plate or the slight change in the ceiling at the spot. Those under the trap can dodge out the way a +6 on a d6+dex or they take 2d6 points of crushing damage. If they dodge the trap they will be on the far side, otherwise they'll end up trapped beneath the stone and the floor, taking ongoing 1d4 crushing damage a round. The party can raise the stone enough to allow escape on a 7+ on a d6 + Str check, The trap also exposes the mechanism that resets the trap, but it'll take a remove traps check to understand it and followed by 5+ on a d6+Str check to start raising the stone enough to stop ongoing damage using this method. Four such checks are required to allow passage through and a further one to reset the trap completely.</Text>

            <Title>The Absent Necromancer (78-82) </Title>
            <Text>The Absent Necromancer (78-82)
The most recent occupant of these tile-floored chambers was Thandrak The Black, a Necromancer of some note. He used these chambers as his lair and carried out horrific experiments on anyone who he caught. For a time he wander the night, with packs of animated severed hands following him everywhere, seeking out loan travellers to enslave and work upon.  Some ten years ago he disappeared, exploring deeper sections of the dungeon, however because of his device in room 80 which he left working, his legacy 'lives' on. Thandrak himself can be encountered on level 3. The door that leads to this chambers is locked and very strong. 

78. Frescos Of Pain
This room holds a number of wooden benches that are covered in dust and ancient blood stains. You can only wonder at the hours that must have gone into painting the walls that show in extremely vivid and accurate detail the dismemberment of bodies and the creation of undead of various sorts. In fact they are so detailed your find yourself disturbed just looking at them. There is a ornate door in the north wall, depicting a the thin face of glowering hooded man.     

Anyone studying the walls for longer than a turn is cursed for 24 hours such that all dice rolls against undead are at -2 (to hit, to damage, to save etc). However if they are spell casters who have, or will have, access to the Animate Dead spell, they can create Severed Hands instead of the normal undead types. 

79. Horrid Jars 
This room is a jumble of shelves and horrid alchemy instruments. Hundreds of jars, both large and small fill the room, containing all manner of body parts, eyes, arms, brains and worse. Many have yellowed with age, and some of the contents have completed dissolved forming fleshy sediment at the bottom of them. A few work books, empty jars, saws and hooked rods also can be made out in the clutter. 

The animated brain of an early rival to Thandrak floats in one of the jars. Driven mad by his condition, Phzulta (Fah-zool-ta) has plotted his revenge for half a century. Powers from beyond have taken note of his condition and provided him with the means to use magic again. Initial he’ll remain hidden amongst the other jars, having summoned an Unseen Servant when the door first opens. He’ll use telepathy to offer information and power in return for a number of random seeming objects. In actuality he hopes to create a golem that he can inhabit. However his insanity and paranoia will probably bring any party cooperating into conflict with him eventually.   

Brain in a Jar

80. The Necromancers Device
This chamber contains a vile and horrific device, 15 feet square, that contains various automated knives, unholy lenses and magical cogs that turn corpses into various Undead monsters. These monsters patrol parts of the dungeon, dragging back whatever they defeat to the machine, which in turn makes more horrors, including the new undead creature, skull spider swarms.

81. The Hidden Bedroom
Thandraks hidden chamber, containing unwanted treasures guarded by lethal necromantic traps. An Obelisk Key is also found here.

82. Fell Summons
Thandrak used this area to summon spirits and non-corporeal undead. It's now haunted by a single Wraith.</Text>
