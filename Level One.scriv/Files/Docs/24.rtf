\f0\b\fs26 \cf0 Screaming Two Skulls Pig Faced Orcs
\b0 \cb2  - Demogorgon worshippers, relatively new to the dungeon and recently joined by some human berserkers, led by a Wereboar, who will fight alongside the Orcs, until the Orcs get hungry and eat them. They also have been gifted with a Beast of Demogorgon, a two headed Baboon of dire proportions. The beserkers are led by a Wereboar which has carried some favour with some of the orcs. The area of the dungeon they inhabit is multi-tiered and centred around a squat stepped pyramid of ancient original and hidden secrets.}
